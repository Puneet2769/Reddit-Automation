### üìß Email Notifications
- Sends email updates after every posting attempt, successful or failed.
- Provides essential details, including the timestamp, status, and post URL.

### üìä Detailed Logging
- Logs all activities for troubleshooting, performance monitoring, and auditing.
- Logs are stored in a file named `automation.log`.

### ‚è≥ Scheduled Posting and Notifications
- Automates question posting at set intervals, with random delays for variability.
- Sends email notifications immediately after posting and then hourly updates.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Robust Error Handling
- Captures errors during posting and sends email notifications to highlight failures.
