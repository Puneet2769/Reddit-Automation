## Features

- **Automated Posting:** Schedule and post content to Reddit directly from Google Sheets.
- **Content Management:** Organize and edit posts within Google Sheets for easy content updates.
- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling to manage issues like network failures or API rate limits gracefully.

3. **Install Dependencies:**

## Usage

1. **Set Up Google Sheets:**

   - Create a new Google Sheet with the following columns: `Title`, `Content`, `Subreddit`, `Scheduled Time`.
   - Populate the sheet with the posts you wish to schedule.

2. **Configure API Credentials:**

   - Obtain Reddit API credentials by creating an application on [Reddit's App Preferences](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps).
   - Set up Google Sheets API credentials by following the [Google Sheets API Quickstart](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/python).
   - Store these credentials in a secure location and update the `config.py` file with the paths to your credentials.

3. **Run the Script:**

   ```bash
   python automate_reddit_posts.py
